One Hour One Life a multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building by Jason Rohrer

## [Documentation](https://onehouronelife.com/)

This is open source, thanks Jason! My sister wanted to be able to run her own server, so I made her an egg.

## Install notes

First install will take a while because the games source code and assets will be downloaded and the games executable will have to be compiled.

## Installation/System Requirements
|  | Bare Minimum | Recommended |
|---------|---------|---------|
| RAM | 2GiB | 2GiB |
| Storage | 1GiB | 1GiB |

### Notes

As this is my first egg, I haven't yet worked out how to make it check for version updates, etc. Any help would be appreciated.

At the very least, if reinstalling for a version update, back up your server first so you can restore files.
